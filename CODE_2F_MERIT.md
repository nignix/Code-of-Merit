# Code (2d) of Merit

1. The creators and lead developers of the Project constitute the Project's 
excutive council or board. The council has final say in every decision of or 
concerning the Project, technical or otherwise, including overruling previous
decisions, without limitation.

2. Contributions are an expected result of your membership on the Project.
Don't expect others to do your work or help you with your work forever. 

3. All members have the same opportunities to seek any challenge they want
within the Project. 

4. Authority or position in the Project is proportional only to your accrued 
contribution to the Project. Seniority must be earned.

5. Software is evolutive: the better implementations must supersede lesser
implementations. Technical advantage is the primary evaluation metric.

6. The Project is a community, but it has a specific purpose. The Project 
is a space for technical prowess; topics outside of this scope will not be 
tolerated and will be deleted without apology.

7. Non-technical conflicts are outside the scope of the Project and thus 
will be discussed in a separate space. Disruption of the Project with
non-technical conflicts will not be tolerated and will be deleted without
apology.

8. Individual characteristics--including but not limited to: body, sex, 
sexual preference, race, language, religion, nationality, or political 
preferences--are absolutely irrelevant in the scope of the Project and
will not be taken into account concerning your value or that of your 
contribution to the Project.  Your ideas--and their manifestation in code--
are what matter.

9. As a corollary to Point 8: Discuss or debate the idea, not the person.

10. There is no room for ambiguity. Ambiguity will be met with questioning;
further ambiguity will be met with silence. It is the responsibility
of the originator to provide requested context.

11. If something is illegal outside the scope of the Project, it is illegal
within the scope of the Project. This Code of Merit does not take precedence 
over governing law.  The Project will be governed by and interpeted in
accordance with the laws of [place].

12. This Code of Merit governs the technical procedures of the Project, not 
activities outside of it. These activites are irrelevant in the scope of
the Project.

13. Participation in the project constitutes agreement with this Code of Merit.

14. No objectives beyond the stated objectives of this Project are relevant
to the Project. Any attempt to deviate the Project from its original purpose
of existence--to fundamentally change its telos--will constitute grounds for
remedial action, up to and including expulsion from the Project, in the sole 
discretion of the creators' council.
